# Gang-Of-Four Software Design Patterns

## Structural patterns

### Facade
- Facade design pattern is used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because of a large number of interdependent classes or because its source code is unavailable.
- This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client.
- It typically involves a single wrapper class that contains a set of members required by the client.

### Composite
- The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. 
- The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
- Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
